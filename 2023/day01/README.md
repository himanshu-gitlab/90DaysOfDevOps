- What is DevOps
= DevOps, short form for Development and Operations is a way/methodology of integrating development and operations in the IT industry. Now what is Development and 
  Operations?
  As the name demonstrates
  Development is the building of an application which includes planning, designing and creating a software application. On the other hand, operations are managing and 
  maintaining the application which is live for the users or the purpose it is being built for.

- What is Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure
= Automation: Repetitive tasks such as code deployment/testing/configuration management are automated to save time.
  Tools: Jenkins, Ansible and Docker
  Scalability: Scalability is the use of resources when and where needed and reduced to normal when the requirement is less.
  Example: Live streaming channels- The Infra used for a famous cricket match will be scaled up automatically when the viewers are increased and will be reduced when the 
  users are fewer.
  Tools: Kubernetes
  Infrastructure as Code (Iac): In conventional methodology, a dedicated infrastructure team is involved in managing application infrastructure. DevOps way allows the 
  application team to manage and configure   Infrastructure eliminating dependencies on Infra teams.
  Tools: Terraform, Puppet.

- Why DevOps is Important, etc
= Around 40% of Softwares have shifted to DevOps from the conventional methodology which was being used, and rest are planning to migrate in near future. This makes DevOps 
  learning a must for all IT professionals.
